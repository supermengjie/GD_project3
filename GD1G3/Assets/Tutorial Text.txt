Son, there's a lot to know about being a great boss monster, but let's start off with the basics.

Fly up, down, left and right with the [W][A][S][D] keys.

Move the mouse around to change where you're aiming your evil gaze.

Click the left mouse button to fire magical attacks at the heroes.

However, every great boss monster must know how to manage their minions. You expend Energy any time you summon.
You can summon different kinds of minions with the [Q],[E],[R], and [F] keys. Each minon type moves a bit different and take different amounts of Energy to summon.
Just watch out, since you're a novice summoner, your minions are likely to end up a bit... Incompetent.
